Details:
In language master table in database, type field for 2-3 entries had additional details enclosed in paranthesis.
e.g. tulu (mother tongue)
Those paranthesis didnot allow to use language type in dynamic naming of fields based on languages in html.
So instead of paranthesis in language type, now using hyphen so that dynamic naming with language type is possible.
Thus in above example, tulu (mother tongue) becomes tulu-mother tongue.
